Finite State Machine is a methodology on how to write code, especially frontend developments, that tracks variables in a way that prevents a lot of styles of bugs.

It basically states that you can be in only one state at a given time. Take for instance, the natural example that you can only be either asleep or awake (except for some weird medical situations). You can't be asleep and awake at the same time, or neither asleep nor awake too.

For each possible state of a system, there are derived states. For example, a derived state of sleeping is that your eyes are closed.
